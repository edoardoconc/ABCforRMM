<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The aim of this project was to study ABC Sampling Techniques for repulsive mixture models in order to solve clustering problems. The code was developed in R considering incrementally more general problems. The most general model formulation is the following:

### Packages

The entire code was written in R. The important packages we used are:
* coda, gtools, transport, MCMCpack

* MASS, extraDistr, spatstat
 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To run the sampler you just need to open the main file, which is ABCForNormalMixture.
